    <description>Slap on a few Orbital Relay Launch Modules onto a traditional transport pod and Voilà! You've got a ship capable of return flight! It's just a first step, though.</description>

    <label>SRTS Skip</label>
    <description>This vessel design was conceived after a nearby colony on this world tried their own version of a superpod. They decided to take apart the pods and put it together uniquely. It turned out really nice, and since then it's become popular as a design due to its cheap material cost and reliable transport. Has military potential.</description>

    <discoveredLetterTitle>Short Range Transport Shuttles</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You've unlocked the ability to craft your own ship parts!\n\nBuilding a shuttle is expensive and time consuming, but absolutely worth the cost.\n\nYou will find your ship blueprints under the SHIP tab, in your architech menu. Build the ship components necessary to craft your vessel in a Fabrication bench, or buy them from traders.\n\nYou won't need these parts for your Skip, but you will for all the future shuttles.</discoveredLetterText>

    <description>A large transport freighter for cargo. We don't know the history of this ship, but it's everywhere. You can find an SRTF on every homeworld in the millions. Not great on the chemfuel mileage and very slow, but the cargo room is amazing.</description>

    <description>The Albatross X-11 was originally designed for military exoplanetary exploration, but you've realized the components match the SRTS almost exactly. With this new insight and some tinkering you might come up with an improved SRTS design with better fuel capacity and efficiency.</description>

    <description>After more research, you discover a new technique originally used by an ancient exctinct alien civilization. This process infuses the ship with this technology while using fewer materials in the build, meaning the new model should be lighter, faster, and with more hauling capacity with the same physical outer hull size as the Mk. II.\n\nThe schematic shows a vast bomb bay.</description>

    <description>The Genesis is a highly advanced transport shuttle that utilizes uranium for fuel, and incorporates archotech level technology to increase the cargo space beyond dimensional boundaries. This is "Blue box" level stuff.\n\nThis blueprint seems like it simply won't work with how advanced it is, but we won't know unless we try.</description>

    <discoveredLetterText>A few of the components needed to build the Genesis elude you. You don't think you can craft them yourself being how complicated they are. At least not yet.\n\nFor now, buy the more advanced components from traders or as quest rewards to build the Genesis.</discoveredLetterText>

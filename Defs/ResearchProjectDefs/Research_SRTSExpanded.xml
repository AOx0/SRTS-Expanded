    <description>Slap on a few Orbital Relay Launch Modules onto a traditional transport pod and Voilà! You've got a ship capable of return flight! \n\nIt's just a first step, though. This won't travel quickly and it'll be a bumpy terrible ride! Perfect, right?</description>

    <discoveredLetterTitle>Congratulations!</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You can now craft a short range transport shuttle! The superpod is slapped together and rattles something fierce on the inside, but you'll find it's steady and stable when you need it most.\n\nCheck the SHIP tab in your architect menu.</discoveredLetterText>

    <description>This vessel design was conceived after a nearby colony on this world tried their own version of a superpod. They decided to take apart the pods and put it together into a far more aerodynamic form. \n\nIt exceeded expectations, and since then it's become popular on this rimworld as a design due to its cheap material cost and reliable transport.</description>

    <discoveredLetterTitle>Short Range Transport Shuttles</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You've unlocked the ability to craft your own ship parts!\n\nBuilding advanced shuttles is expensive and time consuming, but absolutely worth the investment.\n\nYou will find your ship blueprints under the SHIP tab, in your architech menu. Build the ship components necessary to craft your vessel at a Fabrication bench, or buy them from traders.\n\nYou won't need these parts for your Skip, but you will for all the future shuttles.</discoveredLetterText>

    <description>A large transport freighter for cargo. We don't know the history of this ship, but it's everywhere. You can find an SRTF on every homeworld in the millions. Not great on the chemfuel mileage nor the speed, but you will be happy as a muffalo in winter at the cargo space!</description>

    <description>The Albatross X-11 was originally designed for military exoplanetary exploration, but you've discovered valueable insight into how ships work thanks to the efforts of your researchers. You're just a few steps away... \n\nYou think this new ship will outshine all current designs by a mile.</description>

    <description>After more research, you discover a new technique originally used by an ancient exctinct alien civilization. This process infuses the ship with this technology while using fewer materials in the build, meaning the new model should be lighter, faster, and with more hauling capacity with the same physical outer shell limits.</description>

    <discoveredLetterText>A few of the components needed to build the Genesis elude you. You don't think you can craft them yourself being how complicated they are. At least not yet.\nFor now, buy the more advanced components from traders or as quest rewards to build the Genesis.\n\nThe things you've heard about this ship must be exaggerated, right? It's probably just a myth...</discoveredLetterText>
